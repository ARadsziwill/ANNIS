ANNIS {#mainpage}
======

ANNIS is an open source, browser-based search and visualization architecture
for multi-layer corpora. It can be used to search for complex graph structures
of annotated nodes and edges forming a variety of linguistic structures, such
as constituent or dependency syntax trees, coreference and parallel alignment
edges, span annotations and associated multi-modal data (audio/video). 

This documentation is targeted to developers or administrators.
