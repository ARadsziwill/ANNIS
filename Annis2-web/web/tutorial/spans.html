<h2>Searching for Annotations</h2>
<p>Annotations may be searched for using an annotation name and value. The names of the annotations vary from corpus to corpus, 
though most corpora contain part-of-speech and lemma annotations with the names pos and lemma respectively (annotation names are <strong>case sensitive</strong>). 
For example, to search for all forms of the German verb <em>sein </em>'to be' in a corpus with lemma annotation such as PCC3, simply select the PCC3 corpus and enter:</p>
<tt>lemma="sein"</tt>
<p>To only find finite forms of this verb in PCC3, use the part-of-speech (pos) annotation concurrently, and specify that both the lemma and pos should apply to the same element:</p>
<tt>lemma="sein" &amp; pos="VAFIN" &amp; #1 _=_ #2</tt>
<p>The expression <tt>#1 _=_ #2</tt> uses the span identity operator to specify that the first annotation and the second annotation apply to exactly the same position in the corpus.
Annotations can also apply to longer spans than a single token: for example, in PCC3, the annotation <tt>Inf-Stat</tt> signifies the information structure status of a discourse referent. 
This annotation can also apply to phrases longer than one token. The following find spans containing new discourse referents, not previously mentioned in the text:</p>
<tt>exmaralda:Inf-Stat="new"</tt>
<p>If the corpus contains no more than one annotation type named <tt>Inf-Stat</tt>, the optional namespace (in this case <tt>exmaralda</tt>) may be dropped. In order to view the span of tokens to which this annotation applies, wait for the interface to retrieve the hit count for this query and click on &quot;Show Result&quot;, then open the exmaralda annotation level to view the partiture containing the span. Further operators can test the relationships between potentially overlapping annotations in spans. 
  For example, the operator <tt>_i_</tt> examines whether one annotation fully contains the span of another annotation:</p>
<tt>Topic="ab" &amp; Inf-Stat="new" &amp; #1 _i_ #2</tt>
<p>This query finds aboutness topics (<tt>Topic="ab"</tt>) containing information structurally new discourse referents.</p>
