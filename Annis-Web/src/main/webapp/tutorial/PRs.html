<h2>Searching for Pointing Relations</h2>
<p>Pointing relations are used to express an arbitrary directed relationship between two elements (terminals or non-terminals) without implying dominance or coverage inheritance.
For instance, in the pcc2 demo corpus, elements in the <tt>mmax:</tt> namespace may point to each other to express coreference or anaphoric relations.
The following query searches for two <tt>np_form</tt> annotations, which specify for example whether a nominal phrase is pronominal, definite or indefinite.
</p>
<tt>mmax:np_form="pper" & <br>mmax:np_form="defnp" & <br>#1 &#8209;&gt;anaphor_antecedent #2</tt>
<p>
Using the pointing relation operator <tt>-&gt;</tt> with the type <tt>anaphor_antecedent</tt>, the first <tt>np_form</tt>, which should be a personal pronoun (<tt>pper</tt>), is said to be the anaphor to its antecedent, the second np_form, which is definite (<tt>defnp</tt>).
To see a visualization of the coreference relations, open the mmax annotation level in the example corpus. In the image below, one of the matches for the above query is highlighted in red (<i>die Spieler ... sie</i> 'the players ... they'). Other discourse referents in the text (marked with an underline) may be clicked on, causing coreferential chains containing them to be highlighted as well.
